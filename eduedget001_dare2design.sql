Even a \"free\" app needs to provide a revenue source for backend support.  Time to develop the app is not free, but this could be stated in hours of work required.\r\nPay attention to the log book formatting, make sure answers line up to questions when using column formatting.

Most people go for usual oil spill cleanup inventions, or garbage clean up inventions which are already out there. But you\'re growing kelp?! Wow! Very cool and neat idea. I just want to say your pitch did feel a little rushed, and you seemed nervous. Don\'t be nervous- you have a pretty cool invention! Slow down, relax and really grab your audiences attentions. If I can make a suggestion, start your pitch off with a hook. Maybe a question or a scenario to really grab your audience\'s attention! I do have one question, will the kelp still adequately grow if there is an overwhelming amount of garbage in the ocean in that area? I was also curious as to why you chose the Pacific Northwest to place the device. I think it\'s a good idea, because the water there stays about the same temperature year around, but also consider things like tsunamis when plotting where to put the device! Overall, an interesting and cool invention. Good luck!'),
(207, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'BeatRunner', 'Hi guys! I really enjoyed listening to your invention idea. I completely agree that music motivates people because when I run at the gym, if I put my music on shuffle and a slow song comes on, I\'m mad because it immediately kills my vibe. I think this is definitely something that could be marketed. I want to also say to start of your pitch by selling the audience. Ask an attention grabbing question or scenario to really capture the audience\'s attention. Overall, nicely done and I can see this being something in the future to have. Good luck!'),
(208, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Auto Door Sanitizer', 'Hi guys! This was such a cool invention to read about! I think this is very useful and very important to have especially during flu and COVID seasons. It\'s honestly just crucial to have at all times of the year. I think the only questions I have are: How often would it need to be refilled with sanitizing chemicals? And how long would the adhesive last? Other than that, a job well done. Very interesting invention and I hope we have something like this in the future!'),
(209, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Virtual Assimilation', 'Hello! Wow I am absolutely blown away by the amount of work you put into this! A job well done, definitely. I really like this invention a lot because I suffer from motion sickness myself so this definitely hit home for me. I\'ve always had interest in trying out VR, although I could never do it long because I would probably puke from the dizziness. Your invention would help a lot of people just like me! Despite all the positives, I had to give you half credit on your video pitch because it was a bad link. I know that\'s not something you can control, but maybe post it on Youtube using a public account/viewing. It told me I was forbidden to access the video. Either way, I know you submitted one so it would be unfair to give you a 0/15 on it, so I gave you half credit. This is an awesome invention. Good luck! '),
(210, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Blue Light Eye Protection', 'Hello! I really liked your idea and thought it was pretty important especially in today\'s time where everyone and anyone is on their phones and computers because we are faced with a global pandemic. I also want to say that your video pitch was the only pitch I\'ve seen that actually made me smile and laugh! I was looking for this aspect in all of the presentations, but yours was the only one that did it for me! I also wanted to say that I liked that you actually hand made a prototype and I could even see it at use! That being said, I did have to score you a 0 on logbook because you do not have one, and also there\'s not much information on different trials and errors during your invention process. I think you should add more details on different trials, add a logbook, and you also need resources to provide support for your invention. Good luck!'),
(211, 'Amy Johnson', 'BeatRunner', 'Nice job! I would definitely use this product if you were able to expand it to include matching music to strokes per minute for a rowing machine. I don\'t think it would be too difficult to modify as you could still likely use the foot pressure sensor to measure when one pushes off to initiate the stroke.\r\nWhile the logbook is for your team, I would keep in mind that it is not *just* for your team. It would be helpful to have more detailed explanation for how you filled out the decision matrix, for example. You may also want to consider eliminating abbreviations (e.g., idk) and more conversational terms and spellings (e.g., random people, lil).\r\nIf you move on to the next round and have a chance to re-record your pitch, I would recommend 1) not having a ceiling fan in the recording frame and 2) changing the color scheme on the slide with the example of the coding as it was very difficult to read. \r\nIt would also be great to include the coding in the log book, as well as the questions and answers you received from your survey of potential users.'),
(212, 'Amy Johnson', 'The Dream Team', 'This is a really cool idea, I just wish I knew more about it. You only used about half of your allotted pitch time, so you had the opportunity to explain more of the process of your feeder\'s design and its features. For example, how does the power cord feed through the tiny hole in the bottom of the feeder? Does it detach from the heating pad or is the hole shown not to scale?\r\n\r\nWhile the logbook is for your team, I would keep in mind that it is not *just* for your team. Here is where you could have included potential user survey questions and responses as well as a more detailed narrative about how the project progressed over time. Also, you may want to reread it to consider if everything in there is something you would want a judge to read. You spent a lot of space in your logbook on the marketing of the product, but very little on the product itself. It may be beneficial to shift your efforts to more closely fit the requirements of the project. '),
(213, 'Amy Johnson', 'Kloehn & Chadha', 'Handy idea! I can definitely see how this would be useful to someone who spends a lot of time in a vehicle. I do wish I understood more about the refinement process for the design. You do a nice job of describing what changes in the design occur, but it is not clear to me why those changes were made. The drawings a helpful, but really tiny in the video viewer so it is hard to make out the details. You had time extra left for your video, so you could have included fewer images per slide in order to make them larger and easier to view. Including a log book would also have made it easier to include more and larger images as well as more details about the project.\r\nSome things I wondered about: Will this fit into different sized cup holders (some are larger than others)? How does the top rubber part accommodate different shaped and sized sauce cups? It looks to be one continuous piece. Also, how does the top fit on to keep spills from happening? How much will this cost to manufacture?'),
(214, 'Amy Johnson', 'Walking Shipping Container Home', 'Such a very cool idea!\r\nIf you are to move to the next round of competition and have the opportunity to re-record your pitch, I\'d consider 1) having the slides take up more of the screen so the information on the slides is a bit larger and easier to see and 2) either not sit in a chair that swivels or be mindful of not swiveling during the presentation.\r\n\r\nI wondered about the cost of moving a home in the more traditional way. You may have had that on one of the slides but I couldn\'t clearly read it and I don\'t recall you talking about it. Also, do you have a sense of how much this system you\'ve designed will cost? Can the system be used separately from the shipping container home if someone liked the idea but wanted a home constructed from wood, let\'s say, or must they be used together? Did you do any potential user surveys? It would be great to include the questions and responses in your log book.\r\nKeep up the good work!'),
(215, 'Amy Johnson', 'Blue Light Eye Protection', 'I completely understand the need for this product, but I wish I knew more about it. Many aspects of the required information are missing. You had a lot of time left for the video, so there was the opportunity to include more information. The log book was also missing, which was another avenue for reporting on the process of the project.\r\nIt feels like an updated version of the old \"blue blocker\" glasses. It would be great to know how these are different. How much would they cost? Did you do any potential user surveys (beyond the guy in the video)? If so, what were the questions and the responses?'),

Group one is plastic, metal, and glass i.e. the recyclables, and group two is anything else. Each step will be explained in detail after this paragraph. Step two(prototype 2) is when everything in group 1 is sent to a washer that will clean it. After everything is cleaned it moves on to step 3 which is it gets sorted again. This time it sorts metal, plastic, and glass into separate groups. Each of these groups except glass will be sent to step 4. The glass will be sent to a normal trash can.

The machine can automatically raise and lower dots to create different characters when it receives input.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The question I need to research is - how can one control hundreds of tiny machines effectively?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prototype design Iteration #1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My initial idea was to create a handheld device, a sort of glove, that a visually impaired person could use to read when they wore it.

Even though it provides for a more portable device, the invention would not be very easy to use, which is one of my criteria.

However, this method is not favorable. The smallest braille displays are quite large, often weighing over one pound.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prototype design Iteration #3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I wanted to find a better system than the one currently used, so I began to research miniature actuators.

This is useful in microfluidics because channels can be etched into the material and shrunk to miniaturize the size of a circuit. My design used the principles of a tesla valve combined with the organization of the copper wire grid. A tesla valve is a pipe with small notches that restrict the free flowage of water. Below is a design of what I wanted to create, showing one row of braille dots. Working similarly to the copper wire grid idea, I would generate a force on one end of the pipe.

My main problem was that commercially available solenoids were too large for the scale of my project. I realized that if I created one of my own, I could miniaturize my product on a significant scale. I purchased some magnet wire and began to experiment. Building a working electromagnet is dependent on the number of coils, the number of coil overlaps, and the core material. I soon realized that creating these without a solenoid winder would be very difficult. I changed the core material and the amount of voltage applied with each iteration, but the electromagnet still wouldn&rsquo;t produce a magnetic field. Below is an image of my initial planning and attempts.

Due to the irregularities in the water-filled tubes I constructed, the water wouldn&rsquo;t create enough of a bulge. I then began experimenting with the tubes to see what kind of pressure and what location would produce the desired result. Soon, I found that if the tube is pinched or bent in a certain spot, the tube will begin to lift upwards.

These looked good at first, but I realized that there were two types of potentiometers; digital potentiometers and mechanical potentiometers. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to operate digital potentiometers, so I moved on. At some point, I may come back to this idea.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This left only the relay switch. The relay switch uses specially curved electromagnetic coils to modulate the voltage. I decided to buy an 8-channel relay switch. Before hooking it up,&nbsp; I created a wiring diagram (shown below).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5kadts_Xg-tVKSfybHRh5Fe_V-cEkQ6qQZ7CsCjNy1JU8FxEkM-iSSECCBK10BKT-EJ6FgNWCuAaFoly_CwvUN7GqJYoasoIYOCCRKSWaXP4Ro8Ambeio08vsuRf1Q\" style=\"height:279px; width:555px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Here are some pictures of my attempts:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8-channel relay switch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q1HBpdpWgs2C68uOegXxvFVmaNdk3x5ssRWF5tiA_yQzoXP3Jb7eTmtFzVuQeylROF4Y7FGKZfkNxUvn3hSqoqjVhvR3J5h7OYXRNyoGd7mMXlyaT_kWtiAk05NaEg\" style=\"height:290px; width:318px\" /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uOEq8oKsCwPBRrfEmPBhpxf-iS-LKhKv-2u9qX-ouvekldunQUy51duhUgExMhYk96epzxPBX_CQfQ_OWAOZGur6yeSUySAdbZq9Qhwg_xzYIMjdoKtN3MMK0xE5Iw\" style=\"height:286px; width:383px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n ', '2022-02-19 07:08:35'),

After that, step one(prototype 1) starts happening. Step one is where all the stuff you have thrown into will be sorted into two groups. Group one is plastic, metal, and glass i.e. the recyclables, and group two is anything else. Each step will be explained in detail after this paragraph. Step two(prototype 2) is when everything in group 1 is sent to a washer that will clean it. After everything is cleaned it moves on to step 3 which is it gets sorted again. This time it sorts metal, plastic, and glass into separate groups. Each of these groups except glass will be sent to step 4. The glass will be sent to a normal trash can. The plastics and the metals will be sent to step 4 which is a compactor that will compact all the plastics and the metals until they are emptied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1 will first allow 2-3 pieces of trash to be lowered onto a conveyor belt. On the conveyor belt, there will be a camera using R-FCN(Region-based Fully Convolutional Network) which is an object recognition algorithm to sense what the trash is. For this stage, it will sort between group 1(plastic, glass, metal) and everything else but it will use a 40% match rate to sort instead of the default 95%. This stage is mainly done to reduce the amount of trash getting into the washer. So a 40% match rate is done because object recognition software struggles to identify the object unless it is clean. So a 40% match rate will allow it to reduce the amount of trash in the cleaner and still have all of group 1 be sent to the washer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2 will have all of group 2(plastic, metal, glass) filling up inside it until it reaches 50% capacity. After that happens the cleaning cycle starts. The cycle starts with the 5 power washers spraying the plastic. They will have 4 on each side of the container and 1 on the top of the container. The pressure washers are all 500 psi and will be one for one minute. After one minute the inner container will spin for 30 seconds. This is done to dry the plastic as much as possible. After the spin is done then the bottom of the container will open and allow all the plastics to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 sorts group one into three separate groups which are plastic, glass, and metal. The sorting is done in the same format as step 1 but this time it is sorted between glass, metal, and glass. After this is done glass is sent to its trash can while metal and plastic are sent to step 4.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4 is another cleaner. It works exactly the same as step 2 after that metal and plastic are sent to step 4. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4 is a compactor. The compactor starts to compact after it reaches 75% capacity. After that happens it starts crushing the metal and the plastic from the top. This is done to reduce the number of times the trashman has to pick it up. If even after it is compacted and it&#39;s at 90% capacity then they will let the pickup crew know to come and get it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This machine will be half underground to reduce the amount it intrudes above the ground.

Group one is plastic, metal, and glass i.e. the recyclables, and group two is anything else. â€‹</li>\r\n	<li>Step two is when everything in group 1 is sent to a washer that will clean it. â€‹</li>\r\n	<li>Step 3 is another sorter. This time it sorts metal, plastic, and glass into separate groups.â€‹</li>\r\n	<li>Each of these groups except glass will be sent to step 4. The glass will be sent to a normal trash can. â€‹</li>\r\n	<li>Step 4 is another cleaner the same as step 2 after that it goes to step 5. â€‹</li>\r\n	<li>Step 5 is a compactor that will compact all the plastics and the metals until they are emptied. This step also includes the trash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1 will first allow 2-3 pieces of trash to be lowered onto a conveyor belt. On the conveyor belt, there will be a camera using R-FCN(Region-based Fully Convolutional Network) which is an object recognition algorithm to sense what the trash is. For this stage, it will sort between group 1(plastic, glass, metal) and everything else but it will use a 40% match rate to sort instead of the default 95%. This stage is mainly done to reduce the amount of trash getting into the washer. So a 40% match rate is done because object recognition software struggles to identify the object unless it is clean. So a 40% match rate will allow it to reduce the amount of trash in the cleaner and still have all of group 1 be sent to the washer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2 will have all of group 2(plastic, metal, glass) filling up inside it until it reaches 50% capacity. After that happens the cleaning cycle starts. The cycle starts with the 5 power washers spraying the plastic. They will have 4 on each side of the container and 1 on the top of the container. The pressure washers are all 500 psi and will be one for one minute. After one minute the inner container will spin for 30 seconds. This is done to dry the plastic as much as possible. After the spin is done then the bottom of the container will open and allow all the plastics to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 sorts group one into three separate groups which are plastic, glass, and metal. The sorting is done in the same format as step 1 but this time it is sorted between glass, metal, and glass.

I also had a problem with the way it was using the pressure washer. It was going up and down using a motor and a gear rack which had two problems. Problem was that it would be slow. Problem two is it is unnecessary because the nozzle of the pressure washer would already cover a wide range. So it would increase the cost for no reason. I also have a problem with prototype 1(sorter). Even the best object recognization software struggle with recognizing the object if it is dirtied up.

To address the pressure washer problem I would take out the mechanism that makes it go up and down and instead put in 5 different pressure washers instead of 3. I would do this so that way it would clean all the sides and not just 3 sides of the container. To address the problem with the object recognization software not recognizing it I would change the way it was sorted in the first place. How the sorting would work now is.

Problem two is it is unnecessary because the nozzle of the pressure washer would already cover a wide range. So it would increase the cost for no reason. I also have a problem with prototype 1(sorter). Even the best object recognization software struggle with recognizing the object if it is dirtied up. So the problem would be it wouldn&#39;t be able to sort them properly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Variation 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A problem I still had was that not only the plastic, glass, and metals were being sent to the trashcan/ compactor some of the other stuff was still being sent. Another problem I had was that after getting the wet paper is useless for recycling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p><strong>Variation 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address the problem with prototype 2 I would change the shape of it to be a cylinder that way everything is cleaned properly. To address the pressure washer problem I would take out the mechanism that makes it go up and down and instead put in 5 different pressure washers instead of 3. I would do this so that way it would clean all the sides and not just 3 sides of the container. To address the problem with the object recognization software not recognizing it I would change the way it was sorted in the first place. How the sorting would work now is. First, the trash you threw would be at the top of the machine. Then, it will allow 2-3 pieces of trash to be lowered onto a conveyor belt. On the conveyor belt, there will be a camera using R-FCN(Region-based Fully Convolutional Network) which is an object recognition algorithm to sense what the trash is. For this stage, it will sort between group 1(plastic, glass, metal) and everything else but it will use a 40% match rate to sort instead of the default 95%. This stage is mainly done to reduce the amount of trash getting into the washer. So a 40% match rate is done because object recognition software struggles to identify the object unless it is clean. So a 40% match rate will allow it to reduce the amount of trash in the cleaner and still have all of group 1 be sent to the there compactors except for glass which will sit in a normal bin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Variation 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To fix that problem I added an extra cleaning process for the plastic and the metal before it reaches the compactors. I took at the paper portion of the machine.</p>\r\n ', '', '2022-05-12 03:18:03');

The braille display connects with the camera either wired or wirelessly and displays the braille fonts. Unlike the braille display currently available in the market, my braille display solution uses sustainable miniature electromagnetic solenoids and innovative soft pneumatic actuators.

Rather, it is a diary that is continuously filled in as you work on your invention. Follow the steps of the invention process and fill out the various pages as you work on them. When you are done with a page, print your name and the datebr at the bottom. If you need extra space for any section, make copies of the Blank Page (Page 17) and use that for any purpose. Once you are done, put the pages in the order in which you did them and staple them to make a complete Invention Log. This log will also be used as part of the final presentation and needs to be filled in using complete sentences (except for things like a list of materials). Teams share one Invention Log and should attach signatures of all inventors.', '2021-07-08 03:22:41'),

After watching your video pitch and reading through your logbook, I have a couple questions: Does any size cup fit in the cup holder? Does the clip stay on with only tape or is something else holding it in place? Considering you have more time in your video and if you were to move on to the next round, I would suggest talking about who you interviewed and what they said when you asked them about what they think you should have added to your design to make it the best umbrella cup holder possible. Lastly, in your logbook, be clear about what is included in the price of $35 (cup holder, clip, pouch) and what the consumer would have to purchase separately (umbrella, cup, etc.).

I just wish that I knew more about it and could see more of it:) The screen shot you included in your logbook is very tiny, so if you move on in the competition, it would be good to enlarge it to be easily read in the document. Do you have more of the script for the game written? If so, it would be great to include that! It would also be very interesting to see video of you playing the game. While you did include some footage of you interacting with the game in the pitch, the angle that it was filmed at made it difficult to see. More video of you playing the game or screen shots would be a great addition to your pitch and logbook. Good use of statistics to provide context to the need for this product, though I do wonder if there are more recent updates to the 2016 data.\r\n\r\nOther things I wondered about as I watched the pitch: Did you get feedback from users of the game? If so, what were their comments? Did you use any feedback to improve or change the game? \r\n\r\nHow did you make the game? What software or programming did you use?

Did you do any interviews with potential users after you built your prototype to get feedback on it? That could be a nice addition to the project.\r\n\r\nAs I was watching your pitch, I found myself wondering about the comparison between the widespread availability of audiobooks to the limited availability of book printed in braille. Clearly, reading is different than listening and that might be a distinction you touch on in your logbook or the pitch video if you think you have time. Plus, your invention has the distinct advantage of being able to read any printed material, which is far superior to an audiobook. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work! I\'m excited to see what the future holds for you:)\r\n', NULL),

Unfortunately, the logbook copy was linked to a different project so I wasn\'t able to view it there either. That will be something to keep an eye on for future rounds of the competition.\r\n\r\nA few things I wondered about as I watched your pitch: Approximately how big will this unit be? Is this something that you image apartment complexes, university dorms, etc. will purchase for their residents to use, or will it be sold direct to consumers? Or, do you think municipalities will purchase them for their residents?  How much trash/recycling can it handle per cycle? How long does a cycle take to run? Is the unit serviceable if a component breaks? What is the projected maintenance schedule? Based on projected wear and tear, how long will a unit last before needing to be replaced? How does the material come out at the end? Does someone need to transport the compacted cubes of trash or recycling to a can for pickup?\r\n\r\nIf you move on to further rounds of the competition, you might consider re-recording your pitch to slow down your rate of speech just a bit. You get going a little fast in places, which is easy to do when you have such a cool thing to talk about:) Also, there are a few typos on the last slide. You might also consider adding a reference slide or include all of your research references in your logbook. Overall, though, really super job!\r\n', NULL);

I think this would be a very good way to reduce e-waste. \r\n\r\nHow would you market this to the public so that rather than viewing this as a hassle, they would view this as better than buying new?\r\n\r\nAs much as I really like your idea it was rather hard to hear what you were saying in your pitch. It isn\'t necessarily your fault, it was the loudness of the background noise. \r\n							,							I think this is a cool idea. I think a lot of people could benefit from this invention. \r\n\r\nAlthough I thought you had a good pitch there were some points where it was hard to hear what was being said. \r\n\r\nMaybe I missed it, but what is the visible stimulus? I understand it is the light, but does it slowly turn on or does it flash? \r\n\r\nIf the light flashes rather than just turns on, how would this impact someone with light-triggered medical conditions like epilepsy? 							,							This is a cool invention! I could see this being used often. \r\n\r\nI thought you had a good pitch but there were some parts that were difficult to understand. I think this could be fixed with a bit of practice. \r\n\r\nI like who this is being marketed to. My only question is what are you thinking the retail price is going to be? 							,							I think this is an amazing idea! I am very impressed with how thought out this invention is.

('Rachel  Rhodes', 'I didn\'t see anywhere how these shoes would be charged/ran - solar powered, battery operated, charged? And how long would/should a charge last? \r\nI noticed in your logbook, you added the story about being stuck in traffic in Philadelphia, maybe adding that story to the video pitch could make it more relatable to the viewers who have most likely also been in that similar situation. \r\n,I noticed in the logbook it was stated that there are \"no problems\" and the invention \"works as planned\" could you think of any ways the invention may not work as planned, for example, over time could the wires get tangled and messy in the mesh bag? Or if there are really no problems, how does your product work against those odds? \r\nIs there anything other than a mesh bag you could use that could work better with sustainability? Like a reusable shopping bag or a recycled material bag? Something that could be recycled or safer to dispose of?\r\nYou make this very relatable to adults that use consoles, but is there any way you could make it relatable other than that? Maybe for older adults what could they use this product for? \r\nWould attaching this product to a desk harm the desk? And can it be easily attatched/detached? \r\nI really enjoyed how you compared your products to similar products, but how yours is different and adds the disadvantages of similar products.

('Kaitlyn Kotcher', 'Comments:\r\n* Great job guys! Your logbook was very detailed and provided me with a lot of information about your whole invention process. I loved getting to see how you tested the cable and how you decided to update your product based on your data collected.\r\n* I marked you guys down on the originality because I have seen other products out there they try to stop this issue of the phone chargers breaking. But I only did 1 point down because I haven\'t seen it to this extent that you guys went by building a cube for the cable to run through.\r\n* I marked you guys down on your online pitch because you had 4 minutes to explain your product to me and only used up 45 seconds. Additionally, only one person spoke in your group, I would have really loved to see each member explain a little bit in your pitch.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What new concepts did you develop about charging cables during this invention?\r\n* What was the most difficult part of your invention process?\r\n* What caught you by surprise as you tested each version?,Comments:\r\n\r\nGreat job guys!\r\nIt looks like you started working on your invention process in late January, which means you must have worked very hard up until now with your product.\r\nYour online pitch was very detailed and thorough which I found very helpful. You included a background in products that are already on the market and explained how yours would be different. \r\nI took off points for the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for ways you knew this was a problem other than what was apparent in your own lives. An example might include asking other co-workers from your summer job if they had the same struggles as both of you. But I did appreciate hearing your own experience and why you guys wanted to pursue this product.\r\nMy main concern is with your logbook. You both really explained what your invention process in the video, however, it is not documented enough in the logbook. I would have loved to see data with other people having this problem. Your research that you found regarding this problem/product. I also would have loved to see how you guys tested your product, how you knew it was successful or not. I did, however, really appreciate the photos you included of your invention. It helped me visualize what it looks like and how it would be used.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* In your video, you mentioned that there were some difficulties when you came to building the product. What were some of those difficulties? How did you make it to your final product?\r\n* In what ways did you test the success of your invention?\r\n* What caught you by surprise when you went through this process.,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Your logbook and video were very detailed and organized, I really enjoyed reading it and watching what you all had to say. Nice job! \r\n* I took some points off on the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for ways you investigated that this garbage situation was a problem in urban areas. I see that you listed off the problem areas, but I was really looking for concrete data for how you knew those problems. An example of this could have been going around apartment buildings and asking their opinions of the current trash system in place. \r\n* I also took some points off of your display board because I was looking for a tri-fold board specifically with your information displayed. It appears to be just a big poster board. I appreciate all of the typed information and pictures you provide on your board, which makes understanding your process much easier. \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during your invention process?\r\n* How did you come up with the price and longevity of the product/\r\n* What did you enjoy most about the invention process?,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Nice work guys! You have a great product that you were able to easily explain so well. I was very impressed.\r\n* As you can see, I had to take a handful of points away for many different reasons. There is no logbook or display board first and foremost. * Additionally, I took off points in the invention process category because I was looking for ways you guys went about your invention process. I was looking for drawings or explanations for your design ideas. I also was looking for how you two modified your product as you went along in the process. I was also looking for ways you knew it this was a problem in your own lives. I really appreciated the resources you cited at the beginning of your video, but I wanted to see concrete data from your own life. For example, asking friends how often they forget to turn off a light or unplug something.\r\n* I took off points for originality because I have seen many products on the market that try to reduce energy usage. But I appreciate the route you guys took it, by going through an app that an individual can manipulate.\r\n* Lastly, for your online pitch I needed to see your faces as you were talking about your product.\r\n* Overall, your invention is very impressive and you both did an excellent job explaining what you created.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during the invention process?\r\n* What did you enjoy the most throughout the invention process/\r\n* What was something that took you by surprise while working on your product?,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Nice work! you explained everything very well, you were detailed and thorough in you your online pitch, which helped me out in understanding your thought process.\r\n* I did not get a logbook, so I wasn\'t able to give you any points for that.\r\n* I took some points away for your online pitch because you went over the time limit a little bit.  \r\n* For your prototype, I was hoping for a further explanation of it, and how you knew it worked as a universal piece. \r\n* I took off points in the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for concrete data about how you knew this was a problem. An example might be asking friends that also play guitar to understand if they have the same issue and documenting their responses. \r\n* Overall, you did great at explaining your invention. I really enjoyed learning about the different products already out on the market, and how you would do it a little bit differently.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during the invention process?\r\n* What did you enjoy most about the invention process?\r\n* During your research, did you discover anything that surprised you, or that you want to research more?
