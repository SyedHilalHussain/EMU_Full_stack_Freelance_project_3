(192, 'Andrew Monticello', 'Toby Wright & Efe Akinci', 'In your video pitch avoid using the word \"So\".  The pitch seemed well rehearsed but left the viewer with many questions.  If control is a key incentive to using a car how does making an autonomous vehicle satisfy that incentive?  Were things like weather, balancing of the bicycle, and battery range considered?  When stating a fact from a study that study should be specifically called out instead of saying \"A study found\".\r\nLog book is needed to properly evaluate the invention.'),

How many people who wear glasses are having this problem with masks fogging up? You can put together a quick survey and send it out to get some quantitative data. \r\nAnother thing to consider is the social value of your product. You gave us some positive impacts (more people may wear masks), but are there any negative impacts? '),
(194, 'Andrew Monticello', 'ID Pen', 'The online pitch seemed like the presenters were reading off of a cue card and did not rehearse well enough.  The speech was too fast and rushed, with too much content for a pitch.  The design alternatives were very similar and did not address the overall problem statement of document fraud.  It would have been better to identify two different solutions and settle on the pen.\r\nTesting did not result in product improvement, or suggestions for product improvement.\r\nMarket study did not address that this invention would require people to carry an additional form of verification and could be seen as an inconvenience. '),

I am only seeing a picture of your product in the Log Book section and can only judge based off of that and your video pitch.\r\n\r\nWhat is targeted market - who are you trying to sell this product to? Is it just iPhone users? \r\n\r\nWhat is the market potential for this? How many people are having this issue and would buy your product? I suggest creating a quick market survey to get some quantitative data.\r\n'),

Avoid specifically calling out ownership or work provided. \"I have to\", or \"we ending up choosing Isaac\'s design.\"\r\nThe app has a limited usefulness to just vocal recognition but does not address the instrumentation part of making music.  The other referenced apps and websites also include chords or chord progressions.  The goal  does not incorporate the entirety of music, instead focusing on a vocal tracker.\r\nCosts do not align between sections.  In the product outcome section the app is stated to be free, while in the Cost section a price and service fee are identified. Even a \"free\" app needs to provide a revenue source for backend support.  Time to develop the app is not free, but this could be stated in hours of work required.\r\nPay attention to the log book formatting, make sure answers line up to questions when using column formatting.  Avoid splitting up sections between multiple pages.\r\nIndividual contributions do not need to be identified.  Avoid statements with the word I, unless specifically asked.'),

(206, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Automatic kelp elevator', 'Hi guys. I really enjoyed your invention. I liked that you are very persistent to save our struggling planet, and you chose something I have never even thought of before. Most people go for usual oil spill cleanup inventions, or garbage clean up inventions which are already out there. But you\'re growing kelp?! Wow! Very cool and neat idea. I just want to say your pitch did feel a little rushed, and you seemed nervous. Don\'t be nervous- you have a pretty cool invention! Slow down, relax and really grab your audiences attentions. If I can make a suggestion, start your pitch off with a hook. Maybe a question or a scenario to really grab your audience\'s attention! I do have one question, will the kelp still adequately grow if there is an overwhelming amount of garbage in the ocean in that area? I was also curious as to why you chose the Pacific Northwest to place the device. I think it\'s a good idea, because the water there stays about the same temperature year around, but also consider things like tsunamis when plotting where to put the device! Overall, an interesting and cool invention. Good luck!'),
(207, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'BeatRunner', 'Hi guys! I really enjoyed listening to your invention idea. I completely agree that music motivates people because when I run at the gym, if I put my music on shuffle and a slow song comes on, I\'m mad because it immediately kills my vibe. I think this is definitely something that could be marketed. I want to also say to start of your pitch by selling the audience. Ask an attention grabbing question or scenario to really capture the audience\'s attention. Overall, nicely done and I can see this being something in the future to have. Good luck!'),
(208, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Auto Door Sanitizer', 'Hi guys! This was such a cool invention to read about! I think this is very useful and very important to have especially during flu and COVID seasons. It\'s honestly just crucial to have at all times of the year. I think the only questions I have are: How often would it need to be refilled with sanitizing chemicals? And how long would the adhesive last? Other than that, a job well done. Very interesting invention and I hope we have something like this in the future!'),
(209, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Virtual Assimilation', 'Hello! Wow I am absolutely blown away by the amount of work you put into this! A job well done, definitely. I really like this invention a lot because I suffer from motion sickness myself so this definitely hit home for me. I\'ve always had interest in trying out VR, although I could never do it long because I would probably puke from the dizziness. Your invention would help a lot of people just like me! Despite all the positives, I had to give you half credit on your video pitch because it was a bad link. I know that\'s not something you can control, but maybe post it on Youtube using a public account/viewing. It told me I was forbidden to access the video. Either way, I know you submitted one so it would be unfair to give you a 0/15 on it, so I gave you half credit. This is an awesome invention. Good luck! '),
(210, 'Courtney Dunbar', 'Blue Light Eye Protection', 'Hello! I really liked your idea and thought it was pretty important especially in today\'s time where everyone and anyone is on their phones and computers because we are faced with a global pandemic. I also want to say that your video pitch was the only pitch I\'ve seen that actually made me smile and laugh! I was looking for this aspect in all of the presentations, but yours was the only one that did it for me! I also wanted to say that I liked that you actually hand made a prototype and I could even see it at use! That being said, I did have to score you a 0 on logbook because you do not have one, and also there\'s not much information on different trials and errors during your invention process. I think you should add more details on different trials, add a logbook, and you also need resources to provide support for your invention. Good luck!'),
(211, 'Amy Johnson', 'BeatRunner', 'Nice job! I would definitely use this product if you were able to expand it to include matching music to strokes per minute for a rowing machine. I don\'t think it would be too difficult to modify as you could still likely use the foot pressure sensor to measure when one pushes off to initiate the stroke.\r\nWhile the logbook is for your team, I would keep in mind that it is not *just* for your team. It would be helpful to have more detailed explanation for how you filled out the decision matrix, for example. You may also want to consider eliminating abbreviations (e.g., idk) and more conversational terms and spellings (e.g., random people, lil).\r\nIf you move on to the next round and have a chance to re-record your pitch, I would recommend 1) not having a ceiling fan in the recording frame and 2) changing the color scheme on the slide with the example of the coding as it was very difficult to read. \r\nIt would also be great to include the coding in the log book, as well as the questions and answers you received from your survey of potential users.'),
(212, 'Amy Johnson', 'The Dream Team', 'This is a really cool idea, I just wish I knew more about it. You only used about half of your allotted pitch time, so you had the opportunity to explain more of the process of your feeder\'s design and its features. For example, how does the power cord feed through the tiny hole in the bottom of the feeder? Does it detach from the heating pad or is the hole shown not to scale?\r\n\r\nWhile the logbook is for your team, I would keep in mind that it is not *just* for your team. Here is where you could have included potential user survey questions and responses as well as a more detailed narrative about how the project progressed over time. Also, you may want to reread it to consider if everything in there is something you would want a judge to read. You spent a lot of space in your logbook on the marketing of the product, but very little on the product itself. It may be beneficial to shift your efforts to more closely fit the requirements of the project. '),
(213, 'Amy Johnson', 'Kloehn & Chadha', 'Handy idea! I can definitely see how this would be useful to someone who spends a lot of time in a vehicle. I do wish I understood more about the refinement process for the design. You do a nice job of describing what changes in the design occur, but it is not clear to me why those changes were made. The drawings a helpful, but really tiny in the video viewer so it is hard to make out the details. You had time extra left for your video, so you could have included fewer images per slide in order to make them larger and easier to view. Including a log book would also have made it easier to include more and larger images as well as more details about the project.\r\nSome things I wondered about: Will this fit into different sized cup holders (some are larger than others)? How does the top rubber part accommodate different shaped and sized sauce cups? It looks to be one continuous piece. Also, how does the top fit on to keep spills from happening? How much will this cost to manufacture?'),
(214, 'Amy Johnson', 'Walking Shipping Container Home', 'Such a very cool idea!\r\nIf you are to move to the next round of competition and have the opportunity to re-record your pitch, I\'d consider 1) having the slides take up more of the screen so the information on the slides is a bit larger and easier to see and 2) either not sit in a chair that swivels or be mindful of not swiveling during the presentation.\r\n\r\nI wondered about the cost of moving a home in the more traditional way. You may have had that on one of the slides but I couldn\'t clearly read it and I don\'t recall you talking about it. Also, do you have a sense of how much this system you\'ve designed will cost? Can the system be used separately from the shipping container home if someone liked the idea but wanted a home constructed from wood, let\'s say, or must they be used together? Did you do any potential user surveys? It would be great to include the questions and responses in your log book.\r\nKeep up the good work!'),
(215, 'Amy Johnson', 'Blue Light Eye Protection', 'I completely understand the need for this product, but I wish I knew more about it. Many aspects of the required information are missing. You had a lot of time left for the video, so there was the opportunity to include more information. The log book was also missing, which was another avenue for reporting on the process of the project.\r\nIt feels like an updated version of the old \"blue blocker\" glasses. It would be great to know how these are different. How much would they cost? Did you do any potential user surveys (beyond the guy in the video)? If so, what were the questions and the responses?'),

I think it would have been more informative if you had some visuals to aid your explanations.  \r\n\r\n'),
(221, 'Marie Jaster', 'Portable Air Filtration Device', 'I think this is a great invention! My only question is lets say somebody wants to use to clean a bigger space, would they buy multiple devices or would it not be as effective? Also how can we trust that it is effectively cleaning the air? Great job!!!'),

An opportunity exists to improve on the negative response of Google Glass .  Clever alternative to the cell phone screen.  A HUD projector may allow the shield to be replaced with minimal expense.\r\nPresentation material was well understood but speech could have use more practice.  Room to improve presentation by not having to move video image.'),

(230, 'Marissa Moore', 'Skellies', 'This invention was a really good idea! I know a lot of friends and family who would definitely use one of your masks to prevent their glasses from fogging up! I like how you mentioned that this product could also help ensure people are wearing their masks correctly because their glasses fogging up would no longer pose an issue! '),
(231, 'Marissa Moore', 'Team Crank', 'This was a good idea for people who constantly need to be charging their iPhones! I liked how you thought of a way to make a portable charger that doesn\'t need to charge and won\'t die soon after you start using it! One thing to improve on in the future is your logbook, the only thing that was included under your logbook link was a single picture of your invention! I would have loved to look at your diagrams, research, and overall process while watching your video and learning about your product! '),
(232, 'Marissa Moore', 'Smart Face Shield', 'Your product was such a unique and useful idea! Phones are so gross and collect so many germs, it would be really useful and practical to invest in your invention! Your research, video, and logbook were all very interesting and I enjoyed imagining the benefits of using your product on my trips to the grocery store! '),
(233, 'Marissa Moore', 'Walking Shipping Container Home', 'Your invention was so complex and unique! This idea had never crossed my mind, but I bet this would be especially helpful in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes! I would have like to seen more about the market viability as well as the environmental and societal effects! Great invention and engineering in designing this product!'),
(234, 'Marissa Moore', 'FruitFresh', 'This would definitely be a product that I would buy! I feel like my fresh produce always goes bad, so it was really neat seeing your research in creating a container that helps you keep your fruit fresh and eat/enjoy it at the best time! I love the detail and research that went into designing this invention! '),
(235, 'Tareq Khan', 'Rainwater Energy Generation', 'Interesting idea and good presentation! The power generated from this approach might not enough for powering the 110 V AC home appliances - try to think about how to increase the output voltage and power. You may also use the vibration of rain falling to generate electricity using a piezoelectric element.\r\n\r\n'),
(236, 'Tareq Khan', 'W-Arm', 'Opening and closing windows automatically based on outside and inside temperature is a nice idea!

This can create a more secure environment for groceries and supplies, as it will identify the face to see who it is and allow access to them to their food. It runs on solar power, and shipments can be combined to conserve fossil fuels, making it an ideal system.\r\nThe Delivery robot will have wheels and drawers for different items. I developed a program in Python 3 that uses a machine-learning algorithm to automate better access control for the delivery robot so that the robot can unlock the right container, based on image recognition. This type of robot can combine deliveries and prevent customers from driving hundreds of miles for items to help avoid emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels of cars. Providing better access control can prevent theft and misplacement of items so that the right items can be delivered to the right owner in the same route. Better access control can help reduce transportation for grocery and other items among many persons. We can combine the shipments of multiple customers using delivery carpools.\r\nThe access control based on image recognition will open the lock for the right drawer so the right food is delivered to the right person and donâ€™t have to travel by road to get the food from the cafeteria/or shops. Also, the delivery robot combines food delivery by room numbers in the same building. The car built by me is a prototype of a delivery robot, and Iâ€™ve used a VNC Viewer to control the movement of the car remotely using a laptop, iPad, or phone. It currently uses the internet to connect to the remote control of the car. VNC is a remote control software that allows you to view and interact with a Raspberry Pi using a simple program (the \"viewer\") on another computer/mobile device anywhere on the Internet.\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '6-8', '2021', 1),

I loved getting to see how you tested the cable and how you decided to update your product based on your data collected.\r\n* I marked you guys down on the originality because I have seen other products out there they try to stop this issue of the phone chargers breaking. But I only did 1 point down because I haven\'t seen it to this extent that you guys went by building a cube for the cable to run through.\r\n* I marked you guys down on your online pitch because you had 4 minutes to explain your product to me and only used up 45 seconds. Additionally, only one person spoke in your group, I would have really loved to see each member explain a little bit in your pitch.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What new concepts did you develop about charging cables during this invention?\r\n* What was the most difficult part of your invention process?\r\n* What caught you by surprise as you tested each version?,Comments:\r\n\r\nGreat job guys!\r\nIt looks like you started working on your invention process in late January, which means you must have worked very hard up until now with your product.\r\nYour online pitch was very detailed and thorough which I found very helpful. You included a background in products that are already on the market and explained how yours would be different. \r\nI took off points for the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for ways you knew this was a problem other than what was apparent in your own lives. An example might include asking other co-workers from your summer job if they had the same struggles as both of you. But I did appreciate hearing your own experience and why you guys wanted to pursue this product.\r\nMy main concern is with your logbook. You both really explained what your invention process in the video, however, it is not documented enough in the logbook. I would have loved to see data with other people having this problem. Your research that you found regarding this problem/product. I also would have loved to see how you guys tested your product, how you knew it was successful or not. I did, however, really appreciate the photos you included of your invention. It helped me visualize what it looks like and how it would be used.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* In your video, you mentioned that there were some difficulties when you came to building the product. What were some of those difficulties? How did you make it to your final product?\r\n* In what ways did you test the success of your invention?\r\n* What caught you by surprise when you went through this process.,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Your logbook and video were very detailed and organized, I really enjoyed reading it and watching what you all had to say. Nice job! \r\n* I took some points off on the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for ways you investigated that this garbage situation was a problem in urban areas. I see that you listed off the problem areas, but I was really looking for concrete data for how you knew those problems. An example of this could have been going around apartment buildings and asking their opinions of the current trash system in place. \r\n* I also took some points off of your display board because I was looking for a tri-fold board specifically with your information displayed. It appears to be just a big poster board. I appreciate all of the typed information and pictures you provide on your board, which makes understanding your process much easier. \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during your invention process?\r\n* How did you come up with the price and longevity of the product/\r\n* What did you enjoy most about the invention process?,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Nice work guys! You have a great product that you were able to easily explain so well. I was very impressed.\r\n* As you can see, I had to take a handful of points away for many different reasons. There is no logbook or display board first and foremost. * Additionally, I took off points in the invention process category because I was looking for ways you guys went about your invention process. I was looking for drawings or explanations for your design ideas. I also was looking for how you two modified your product as you went along in the process. I was also looking for ways you knew it this was a problem in your own lives. I really appreciated the resources you cited at the beginning of your video, but I wanted to see concrete data from your own life. For example, asking friends how often they forget to turn off a light or unplug something.\r\n* I took off points for originality because I have seen many products on the market that try to reduce energy usage. But I appreciate the route you guys took it, by going through an app that an individual can manipulate.\r\n* Lastly, for your online pitch I needed to see your faces as you were talking about your product.\r\n* Overall, your invention is very impressive and you both did an excellent job explaining what you created.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during the invention process?\r\n* What did you enjoy the most throughout the invention process/\r\n* What was something that took you by surprise while working on your product?,Comments:\r\n\r\n* Nice work! you explained everything very well, you were detailed and thorough in you your online pitch, which helped me out in understanding your thought process.\r\n* I did not get a logbook, so I wasn\'t able to give you any points for that.\r\n* I took some points away for your online pitch because you went over the time limit a little bit.  \r\n* For your prototype, I was hoping for a further explanation of it, and how you knew it worked as a universal piece. \r\n* I took off points in the identifying and understanding category because I was looking for concrete data about how you knew this was a problem. An example might be asking friends that also play guitar to understand if they have the same issue and documenting their responses. \r\n* Overall, you did great at explaining your invention. I really enjoyed learning about the different products already out on the market, and how you would do it a little bit differently.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What problems did you face during the invention process?\r\n* What did you enjoy most about the invention process?\r\n* During your research, did you discover anything that surprised you, or that you want to research more?
